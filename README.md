## Case Assembly

*If you have specialized iron tips for heatset inserts, swap in an M2 insert.*

1. Set a soldering iron to the recommended temperature depending on the material of choice (I use 240 degrees F for PLA)
2. Place an M2 heat set insert into a standoff hole, slowly press soldering iron into insert. Continue until the surface of the insert is flush with the standoff surface
