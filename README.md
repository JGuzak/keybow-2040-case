## Case Assembly

*If you have specialized iron tips for heatset inserts, swap in an M2 insert.*

It's recommended to print the case oriented with the rubber feet facing down. Add supports for the rubber feet spaces and USB-C port

1. Remove supports from the print
2. Set a soldering iron to the recommended temperature depending on the material of choice (I use 240 degrees F for PLA)
3. Place an M2 heat set insert into a standoff hole, slowly press soldering iron into insert. Continue until the surface of the insert is flush with the standoff surface
4. Repeat for the remaining 3 inserts.
